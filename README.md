# Load zipped and unzipped csv files in Google Sheets
This is a simple Apps Script to load, sort and manipulate zipped csv files in Google Sheets.

This guide will show you how to take back control of your data by using Google Sheets to consume a file, process it into a new feed that is perfect for your requirements and make it available for use elsewhere. Sheets takes care of automatic updates and error notifications so the data is always fresh. 

The aim is to allow anyone with basic Excel or Google Sheets skills to get extra value from product data without relying on time consuming or expensive developers. If you can make basic pivot tables that is more than enough to create your own custom data source, and if you can write simple Excel/Sheets formulas the customisation options increase significantly..

By default it comes with modes for zipped or unzipped csv files, and tab delimited text files. It it is designed to be easily extensible to deal with other formats if required. 

This script was originally written to be compatible with affiliate product csv feeds from Awin (affiliate window), but it will work with any standard zipped csv file. 

This file conatins two functions. One performs the key functionality and the other provides the settings and triggers it. That allows you to perform using several imports to different tabs in the same Google sheet using the same base code.
